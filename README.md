These are projects that I have worked on using real-world datasets. Many of them were downloaded from kaggle.com. Projects include predicting outcomes using random forest classification, logistic regression, linear regression, ridge regression, etc., also text analysis using SpaCy and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
